### **5. Modern React Patterns**
- **Hooks-First Architecture**: Functional components throughout
- **Custom Hook Patterns**: Data fetching, form handling, and business logic
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and recovery
- **Suspense & Concurrent Features**: Loading states and transitions

## 🤖 OpenAI Integration Highlights

### **Real-World AI Implementation**
```typescript
// AI-Powered Report Generation
const handleExport = async () => {
  const aiAnalysis = await aiAPI.generateReport({
    reportType,
    frameworks: selectedFrameworks,
    complianceData,
    includeCharts,
    includeRecommendations: true,
  });
  
  // Generate report with AI insights
  await exportReportService.generateReport({
    ...exportOptions,
    aiAnalysis, // OpenAI GPT-4 generated insights
  });
};
```

### **Backend Integration**
- **NestJS API**: RESTful endpoints with OpenAI integration
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when AI services are unavailable
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time AI content generation
- **Cost Optimization**: Smart caching and request batching
